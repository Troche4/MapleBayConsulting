      Company Overview
    </div>
    <p>
      We provide Transition Leadership and other services at all levels of an organization: Board of Directors,
      CEO, Managing Director, COO, HR Leader, as well as other operational and functional roles.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is accomplished by providing high energy on-site, day to day leadership, to help ensure the
      company's existing leaders embrace new processes and accountabilities and ensure a successful
      transformation or turnaround. We build high performing teams and provide recruiting, selection or
      mentoring services for the future (succession planning). We will undertake executive coaching
      (on a selected basis), as well as programs for cultural and organizational change.

      Mission and Vision
    </div>
    <p>
      Maple Bay Consulting's mission and vision is business transformation. Business transformation,
      transition or turnaround can be an evolution or a revolution. It doesn't matter
      if it is a course correction or a 180 degree turnaround, the challenge is still the same. It's about leading
      change. It could be an acquisition, a divestiture, a need for a new direction or the need for a new company
      culture. The only solution we have found that leads to success is speed, discipline, and focus and accountability
      around change. In a word, it is leadership. We lead change by taking organizations from transformation to triumph.

        and
        thoughtfulness will be an asset to any company in need of outside leadership."

      <b>CEO</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        &emsp;"I thought you were a tremendous leader, the best I've ever worked for in my career; and I personally
        learned
        a lot by observing the way you in which carried yourself, your approach to handling difficult situations
        (there were a few) and the respect you showed for people."

      <br>
      <b>Managing Director, U.K. based business</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        &emsp;"I learned a great deal from observing your leadership style over the years. Most notably, the patience
        to listen. I think you said, "The Good Lord gave you two ears and one mouth so that you can listen twice
        as much as you talk", some advice from your father if I remember correctly."

      <b>European CIO</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        &emsp;"I have grown so much over the past months with you as a mentor and have admired your ability to
        motivate and lead. Thank you for always being so willing to share your knowledge with me ... you have
        always provided direction and comfort about the future."

      <b>Assistant General Counsel</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        &emsp;"On our very first meeting in Essen in 2003, I had heard a lot before and met a charismatic leader.
        You did not speak too much at all - only listening. I was wondering what this was all about,
        expecting something very different. We built trust over time and got to know each other better
        with our different backgrounds. We derived a good, constructive, trustful and personal relationship
        through the years. And we achieved under your guidance and leadership a lot in Europe and Germany.
        Your statements like "I strongly recommend" or "you should seriously consider" became flying words
        for the German organization. In addition we had a lot of fun. That's good and I would like to say
        thank you very much for all decisions, contributions, help, hints, good comments and recommendations
        throughout the years. I learned a lot out of it and I think it got me and my personality further.
        All was very appreciated and helpful."

        &emsp;"...wanted to drop a note to say thanks and let you know how much of a pleasure it has been to work
        with you over the past 2 years. I certainly appreciate the opportunity you gave me, and I could not
        have asked for any better support than what you provided since I arrived. Thank you also for the
        many successes you were instrumental in helping us achieve and for the culture you have installed
        which helped attract me to this company in the first place."

      <i>
        &emsp;"I enjoyed working under your leadership. I thought about you recently, as we ended a long,
        painful contract negotiation and got what we wanted. I told several people on the team that we
        owe the win to Joe Walker, because every tactic I used, I learned from
        'The Joe Walker School of Negotiating.'"
