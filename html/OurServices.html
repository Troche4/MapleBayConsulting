      Business Transition
    </div>
    <p>
      We provide Transition Leadership and services at all levels of an organization: Board of Directors, CEO, Managing
      Director, COO, HR Leader, as well as other operational and functional roles. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Business transformation, transition or turnaround can be an evolution or a revolution. It doesn’t matter if it is
      a course correction or a 180 degree turnaround, the challenge is still the same. It’s about leading change. It
      could be an acquisition, a divestiture, a need for a new direction or the need for a new company culture. The only
      solution we have found that leads to success is speed, discipline, and focus and accountability around change. In
      a word, it is leadership. We lead change by taking organizations from transformation to triumph. <i id="TalentDevelopment"></i>

      This is accomplished by providing high energy on-site, day to day leadership, to help ensure the company's
      existing leaders embrace new processes and accountabilities and ensure a successful transformation or turnaround.
      We build high performing teams and provide recruiting, selection or mentoring services for the future (succession
      planning).
      We will undertake executive coaching (on a selected basis), as well as programs for cultural and organizational
      change.
    </p>

    <div class="header">
      Talent Development
    </div>
    <p>
      Clear vision, along with honesty and discipline, make for a great leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have often said leaders are people who do what they say they are going to do. That is an exceedingly simple
      statement, but what it really means is that the leader has a clear vision, can articulate it for people to
      understand, and the leader can rally people around it. The leader will always be open, honest, and act with
      integrity. To do what you say you are going to do takes a great deal of discipline. The leader must be strong and
      adhere to deeply held values. She/he must be willing to be
      accountable. 
      What holds true for the leader also holds true for all the talent in your organization. So we impart these lessons
      to all.
      <br id="TeamBuilding">
      <br>
      Maple Bay Consulting accomplishes this by employing a number of tools and methods to assess leadership capability
      and current effectiveness.
      We then create plans to improve.
    </p>

    <div class="header">
      Team Building
    </div>
    <p>
      With the Team to Tactics process, we start with a Team. We can help form a new team or work with an existing team
      to take them to the next stage of development and to a higher level of performance. There is clear evidence that
      the most successful organizations tap into the wisdom of teams.

      In the absence of a Strategic Plan, we help create one.

      Once there is a Strategic Plan, we can then provide a process for tactical execution.

      Therefore, we will establish:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul class="teamElements">
        <li>Team Roster: "First who...Then what" -Jim Collins, <i>From Good to Great</i></li>
        <li>Team Mission: Why we exist. Our <i>raison d'être</i>.</li>
        <li>Team Behavior: How we will treat each other.</li>
        <li id="StrategicPlanning">Team Playbook: What we will do.</li>
        <li>
          Team Schedule: Who (Which team members will do what), What (Goals), When we will do it,
          and how we will know if we are succcessful.
        </li>
        <li>Team Record: Measurement of Team performance from <i>The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team</i> by Patrick Lencioni
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="header">
      Strategic Planning: From Team to Tactics
    </div>
    <p>
      For help establishing the Strategy and moving the company agenda to the Tactical/Execution stage, the Team can
      select from a number of playbooks to build their Strategy:
    </p>
    <ul class="strategyElements">
      <li><i>Good to Great</i> by Jim Collins</li>
      <li><i>What Really Works</i> by Nitin Nohria, William Joyce, and Bruce Roberson</li>
      <li><i>Winning</i> by Jack Welsh</li>
      <li><i>Scenario Planning</i> by Gideon Malherbe</li>
      <li>Strategic Forces</li>
      <li><i>Blue Ocean Strategy</i> by W. Chan Kim and Reneé Mauborgne</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No matter which plays are chosen, you must create a Vision, a Mission, and a Set of Values.
      You must also understand your strengths and weaknesses inside the organization, as well as
      your opportunities and threats outside the organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Team to Tactics can be the platform for execution of an existing or developed Strategic Plan through a
      series of tactical programs or projects, for example:
      <ul class="strategyElements">
        <li>Leadership and Talent Management/Development</li>
        <li>Teams and Team Building</li>
        <li>Sales Effectiveness</li>
        <li>Operational Excellence</li>
        <li>Branding and Marketing</li>
        <li>Product Development (current and new)</li>
        <li>Research and Development</li>
        <li>Financing and Financial Analysis</li>
      </ul>
